# Tic Tac Toe ran by a Discord Bot
## Made with C# .NET Core and DSharpPlus
This project allows the bot to run a game of Tic Tac Toe between 2 users (or an AI).

The command is prefixed with "!ttt @DiscordUser" or "!tictactoe @DiscordUser"

The bot will then launch a Discord Embed with a grid of 9 squares whereas you must select where you would like to place your X or O through Discord reactions.

Add the bot to your server: bit.ly/3ehfw5m
